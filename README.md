# The purpose of this repository is to create a preprocessing of MESH hydrology land surface model


## climate_forcing
A set of scripts for analyzing climate forcing from different forcing sets (e.g., WFDEI, WGC, RDRS, GC).

## geospatial_analysis
In this repository, a series of scripts are written for different purpose, such as zonal statistics, clip a raster file, etc. Multiple scrips can be found to work with both raster and shape files. 

## MESH_parameters
The purpose of this script is to generate MESH distributed parameters for running gridded MESH model. 

## Soil
A set of preprocessing script to read soil datasets and prepare soil layer, including Sand, Clay, and Organic layers which will be used for the creation of MESH parameter file. 

## streamflow
A set of preprocessing works required for streamflow observations, such as extract WSC streamflow records for a period of interest.

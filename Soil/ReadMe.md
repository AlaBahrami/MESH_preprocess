# Extraction of GSDE soil dataset

## Purpose 
The purpose is to read the Global GSDE NetCDF dataset and extract soil variables, such as sand, clay, organic carbon, and soil depth to bedrock for a domain of interest. The original GSDE soil texture dataset for each soil information has eight vertical layers at  30  ̋ × 30  ̋ spatial resolution that is converted to MESH soil layers (e.g., 4 layers). 

## Data access 
The dataset is available online at [GSDE] (http://globalchange.bnu.edu.cn)

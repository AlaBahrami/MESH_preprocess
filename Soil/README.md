# The purpose of this repository is to create a preprocessing of MESH hydrology land surface model


## Forcing_Read
Reads input NetCDF forcing from multiple sources (e.g., GEM-CaPA and RDRS) and calculate and show the differences.

## Soil
A set of preprocessing script to read soil datasets and prepare soil layer, including Sand, Clay, and Organic layers which will be used for the creation of MESH parameter file. 

## streamflow
A set of preprocessing works required for streamflow observations.
